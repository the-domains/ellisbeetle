The concept of Cerukins \\ˈsē-ˈrü-ˈkinz\\ began in 1997 when Sam Cosby's oldest son asked him to tell him a story. His son didn't want him to read a book; he wanted him to make up a story. The stories were about a boy and a beetle. Over time, Sam has created an entire universe called The Ceruladons, which is geared for youth and adults.
